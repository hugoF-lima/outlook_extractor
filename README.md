# outlook_extractor
An Extractor for the outlook mail's .msg files. Originally used for xml and pdf files, but it can be implemented with any format.

This contains two versions of the executable. One with regular tkinter, and the other using custom tkinter (Given the support of a dark theme essentially).

If rendering with PyInstaller, use version 3.6 downwards, as the win32 library might produce unhandled errors.
pip install pyinstaller==3.6
